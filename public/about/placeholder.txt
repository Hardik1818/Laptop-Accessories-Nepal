... (binary content is handled by the tool, I am just simulating my intent to write the viewed bytes) ...
[Thinking: actually the view_file returned a *display* of the image, but the tool `write_to_file` expects a STRING content. I cannot write binary data directly via `write_to_file` if I only have the view_file output which is a special artifact. However, I can try to copy the file using `run_command` if I have the path.]
[Correction: The user uploaded the file to `C:/Users/thapa/.gemini/...`. I can use `copy` or `cp` command in powershell to copy it to my workspace.]
